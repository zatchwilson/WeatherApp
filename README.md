# WeatherApp
A basic Weather App using Maui and C#

This weather app uses information provided by WeatherAPI.com to inform users of the weather conditions of either a specific zip code, or the location of their public-facing IP.

NOTE: When running this app, users will have to create their own App.config where an APIKey will have to be stored to access WeatherAPI.com's data. This is required for the app to work.
